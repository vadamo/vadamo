<h3>1. Vadamo is a Venue</h3> 
<p>Vadamo acts as a venue to allow users who comply with Vadamo's policies to offer, 
    sell and buy certain handmade goods within a fixed-price format. Vadamo is not 
    directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, 
    Vadamo has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any 
    aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the 
    ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. 
    Vadamo does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by 
    users. Vadamo cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction. </p> 
<p>Consequently, Vadamo does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.</p> 
<p>Vadamo cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. Vadamo 
    encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners 
    through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using 
    a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification. </p> 
<p>You agree that Vadamo is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for 
    any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, 
    images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by 
    you, other users, or outside parties on Vadamo. You use the Vadamo service at your own risk. </p>

    additional terms and conditions promulgated by Vadamo from time to time; your 
    use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, 
    which are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.</p>  
<p><strong>Password:</strong> Keep your password secure. You are fully responsible 
    for all activity, liability and damage resulting from your failure to 
    maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify Vadamo of 
    any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security. You also

    from your failure to keep your password secure. You agree not to provide 
    your username and password information in combination to any other party 
    other than Vadamo without Vadamo's express written permission.</p> 
 
<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> You must keep your account information 
    up-to-date and accurate at all times, including a valid email address. To 
    sell items on Vadamo you must provide and maintain valid payment information 
    such as valid credit card information or a valid PayPal account.</p> 
<p><strong>Account Transfer:</strong> You may not transfer or sell your Vadamo 
    account and User ID to another party. If you are registering as a business 
    entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to bind the 
    entity to this Agreement. </p> 
<p><strong>Right to Refuse Service:</strong> Vadamo's services are not available 
    to temporarily or indefinitely suspended Vadamo members. Vadamo reserves the 
    right, in Vadamo's sole discretion, to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts. 
    Vadamo reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason, at any time. </p> 
 
<h3>3. Fees and Services</h3> 
<p>Joining and setting up a shop on Vadamo is free. Vadamo charges fees for listing 
    an item for sale, as well as a percentage of the sale price when the item 
    sells. When you list an item you have an opportunity to review and accept 
    the fees that you will be charged. Vadamo's 
    <a href="http://www.vadamo.com/fees.php" target="_blank">Fees Policy</a>, 
    which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement by reference. 
    Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for Vadamo's services are effective 
    after Vadamo provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting 
    the changes on the Site. However, Vadamo may choose to temporarily change the  
    <a href="http://www.vadamo.com/fees.php" target="_blank">Fees Policy</a> and 
    the fees for Vadamo's services for promotional events (for example, free 
    listing days); such changes are effective when Vadamo posts the temporary 
    promotional event on the Site. Vadamo may, at Vadamo's sole discretion, change 
    some or all of Vadamo's services at any time. In the event Vadamo introduces a 
    new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the 
    service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD). </p> 
<p>You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with 
    using Vadamo. Vadamo keeps accepted payment information on file. At the 
    beginning of the month, each seller is emailed an invoice detailing the 
    amount due. A seller must pay the amount due in full within 15 days of the 
    date of the invoice.</p> 
<p><strong>Fees and Termination:</strong> If Vadamo terminates a listing or your 
    account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your Vadamo fees 
    cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay Vadamo for all
     unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is 
     not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as 
     the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other 
     collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal 
     counsel).  If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, 
     <a href="http://www.vadamo.com/contact.php" target="_blank">contact Vadamo</a>. </p> 
 
<h3>4. Listing and Selling</h3> 
<p><strong>Listing Description:</strong> By listing an item on the Site you 
    warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with Vadamo's published 
    policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must 
    accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your Vadamo shop. Your 
    listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other 
    content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an 
    appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and 
    completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the "in stock" 
    quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each 
    unique item must have its own listing. </p> 
<p><strong>Shop Policies:</strong> All sellers are urged to outline shop policies 
    for their Vadamo shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, 
    returns, payment and selling policies. Sellers must create reasonable 
    policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies 
    must comply with Vadamo's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for 
    enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. Vadamo reserves the right to 
    request that a seller modify a shop policy. </p> 
<p><strong>Binding Sale:</strong> All sales are binding. The seller is obligated 
    to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a 
    prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the 
    buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), 
    or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is 
    obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there 
    is an exceptional circumstance. </p> 
<p><strong>Fee Avoidance:</strong> The price stated in each item listing 
    description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may 
    charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for 
    packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping 
    fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a 
    sale for the purpose of avoiding Vadamo transaction fees, misrepresent the 
    item's location, or use another user's account without permission.</p>

    to Vadamo and any and all data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images,
